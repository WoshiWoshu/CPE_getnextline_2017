# CPE_getnextline_2017
First year mini Project in C. The goal of this project is to write a function that returns a read line from a file descriptor. If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error during the reading, the function will come back NULL. To read a line it will use the macro READ_SIZE which indicates the amount of characters to be read.
